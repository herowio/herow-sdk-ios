# Herow SDK for iOS

## Installation with CocoaPod

* Install CocoaPods  ```$ gem install cocoapods```
* At the root of the sample repository, check if a **Podfile** already exists and if not, create it. This can be done by running: ```$ touch Podfile```
* Add the following parameters to your Podfile:

```
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
source 'https://github.com/herowio/Specs'

platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'YourtTarget' do
  use_frameworks!
  pod 'Herow', '~> 7.0.0'
  # Pods for QuickComplete

  # Pods for testing
  target 'QuickStartTests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
  end
  
  # Pods for testing UI
  target 'QuickStartUITests' do
    inherit! :search_paths
  end

	post_install do |installer|
        installer.pods_project.targets.each do |target|
            target.build_configurations.each do |configuration|
                configuration.build_settings['SWIFT_VERSION'] = "5.0"
                configuration.build_settings['SUPPORTS_UIKITFORMAC'] = 'NO'
                configuration.build_settings['SUPPORTS_MACCATALYST'] = 'NO'
            end
        end
    end

end
```

* Run ```$ pod update``` in your project directory


>**Note:**
>
>Your project is linked to the CoreLocation and CoreData frameworks

## Installation with SwifPackage

* open Xcode swift package Manager and enter the following url:

 **https://github.com/herowio/herow-sdk-swiftPackage**

## Configure the SDK inside the AppDelegate

### Initialize the SDK

* Import HerowConnection module


##### Swift
```
import herow-sdk-ios
```
##### Objectiv-C
```
@import herow-sdk-ios;
```

* Add a HerowInitializer parameter to your AppDelegate

##### Swift
```
var herowInitializer: HerowInitializer?
```
##### Objectiv-C
```
@implementation AppDelegate {
    HerowInitializer *herowInitializer;
}
```


* In the **didFinishLaunchingWithOptions** method, initialize and configure the **HerowInitializer** object with your SDK credentials & environment, and launch synchronization with the **Herow Platform**


##### Swift
```
var herowInitializer: HerowInitializer?
```
```
func application(_ application: UIApplication, didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    herowInitializer = HerowInitializer.instance
    herowInitializer?.configPlatform(.prod).configApp(identifier: "your SDK ID", sdkKey: "your SDK Key").synchronize()
    return true
}
```
##### Objectiv-C
```
- (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions {
    herowInitializer = HerowInitializer.instance;
    [[[herowInitializer configPlatform: HerowPlatform.prod]
        configAppWithIdentifier:@"your SDK ID" sdkKey:@"your SDK Key"] synchronize];
    return YES;
}
```

> **Note 1:**
>
> The **synchronize** method allows to set up the SDK with a configuration file downloaded from the **Herow platform**.
>
> The SDK will start the zone detection process only when the file download is complete.
>
> This configuration file is saved in cache, and the SDK checks for updates at regular intervals.
<!--{blockquote:.note}-->

>**Note 2:**
>
>The HerowInitializer allows you to configure your access to the **HEROW** platform.
> HEROW gives you access to one or several of the following environments:
>
>  - **preProd**: The pre-production platform of the **HEROW** platform
>  - **prod**: The production platform of the **HEROW** platform
<!--{blockquote:.note}-->

>**Warning:**
>
> You will get two different access keys:
>
>   - An access key to log into the HEROW Platform
>   - An access key to use with our mobile SDK. This access key is composed of an SDK ID and SDK Key on Herow. Please make sure you use the good credentials to connect the SDK to the **correct** Herow Platform, otherwise your application won't be able to detect zones.
<!--{blockquote:.warning}-->

## GDPR Opt-ins

The HEROW SDK only works if the GDPR opt-in is given by the end-user. The SDK can share some informations as user datas 



#### Update the opt-ins permissions


##### Swift
```
 HerowInitializer.instance.acceptOptin()
 or
 HerowInitializer.instance.refuseOptin() 
```
##### Objectiv-C

```
[HerowInitializer.instance  acceptOptin];
or 
[HerowInitializer.instance  refuseOptin];
```


> **Note 1:**
>
> If the user is refuse the optin the sdk will not work


## Setting a Custom ID
To set a custom ID, make the following call as soon as the user logs in.
If the user logout, you can use the removeCustomId method.

##### Swift
```
HerowInitializer.instance.setCustomId("customId")

HerowInitializer.instance.removeCustomId()
```
##### Objectiv-C

```
[HerowInitializer.instance setCustomId: "customId"];

[HerowInitializer.instance  removeCustomId];
```
## HEROW Click & Collect

To enable the HEROW SDK to continue **tracking end-users location events** (such as geofences' detection and position statements) happening in a **Click & Collect context** when the app is in the background.

These methods are to be **called during an active session** (app in Foreground) which will enable the SDK to **continue tracking the end-user when the app is put in background.** 

>**Note 1:**
>
> This method only works if the end-user's runtime location permission is at least set to **While in use**.
>
>Apple prevents apps requesting the **Always** Location Runtime Permission from collecting background location data before the user grants the full location permission. 

>**Note 2:**
>
> By default, the **Click & Collect background service will timeout after 2 hours**. This is meant to preserve the initial objective of this feature to locate end-users in the background for Click & Collect scenarios and not provide continuous background tracking.


### How to start the Click & Collect

Call the following method to enable the background service:

* launch clickAndCollect


##### Swift
```
HerowInitializer.instance.launchClickAndCollect()
```
##### Objectiv-C
```
[HerowInitializer.instance  launchClickAndCollect];
```

### How to stop the Click & Collect

Call the following method to disable the background service:
* stop clickAndCollect

##### Swift
```
HerowInitializer.instance.stopClickAndCollect()
```
##### Objectiv-C
```
[HerowInitializer.instance g stopClickAndCollect];
```

## Location Permissions

The sdk needs some permissions to work.
To be able to take background position readings by activating the **clickAndCollect** feature you will need the **whenInUse** permission.
If you want to take readings permanently the **always** permissions will be required.

In these two cases you will also need to activate background mode in Xcode.
![image](background.png)
In addition, the iOS system requires an application to provide a description of the framework usage.

These descriptions can be configured in the **info.plist** file, by adding the following keys:

* The three keys for the location permission

```xml
<key>NSLocationAlwaysAndWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This text is shown when permission to use the location of the device is requested. Note that for the app to be accepted in the App Store, the description why the app needs location services must be clear to the end user.</string>
<key>NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription</key>
<string>This text is shown when permission to use the location of the device is requested. Note that for the app to be accepted in the App Store, the description why the app needs location services must be clear to the end user.</string>
<key>NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription</key>
<string>This text is shown when permission to use the location of the device is requested. Note that for the app to be accepted in the App Store, the description why the app needs location services must be clear to the end user.</string>
```
> **Note**:
>
> From the HEROW SDK version 6.3 onwards, a click and collect feature running as a **background service** is available for temporary user tracking when the app is in the background. This feature does not work with the Always Location permission.




We provide methods for requesting permissions directly through the sdk.
##### Swift
```
HerowInitializer.instance.getPermissionsManager().requestLocation(.always, completion: nil)
   
HerowInitializer.instance.getPermissionsManager().requestLocation(.whenInUse, completion: nil)
```

##### Objectiv-C
```
[[HerowInitializer.instance getPermissionManager] requestLocation:LocationPermissionAlways completion: nil];
 
[[HerowInitializer.instance getPermissionManager] requestLocation:LocationPermissionWhenInUse completion: nil];
```


## IDFA Permission
From iOS 14 to have access to **idfa** you must ask for authorization.
The sdk also provides a method to access it more easily.

##### Swift
```        
HerowInitializer.instance.getPermissionsManager().requestIDFA(completion: nil)
```

##### Objectiv-C
```
 [[HerowInitializer.instance getPermissionManager] requestIDFAWithCompletion: nil];
```

## Debug Mode
You can now follow the execution logs with this method.
##### Swift
```        
GlobalLogger.shared.startDebug()
```

##### Objectiv-C
```
 [[GlobalLogger.shared startDebug];
```
You can stop this mode with this command

##### Swift
```        
GlobalLogger.shared.stopDebug()
```

##### Objectiv-C
```
[[GlobalLogger.shared stopDebug];
```
If you want to save this logs localy or on remote storage system, you can by implementing this interface: **LoggerDelegate** and register it on the GlobalLogger.
In this exemple HerowLogger is a class which implements the LoggerDelegate protocol

##### Swift
```        
GlobalLogger.shared.registerLogger(logger: HerowLogger())
```

##### Objectiv-C
```
[[GlobalLogger.shared registerLogger:[HerowLogger new]];
```
